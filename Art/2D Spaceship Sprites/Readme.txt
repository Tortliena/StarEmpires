Howdy folks! 

Thank you for purchasing this asset pack. If these sprites look familiar, you might be recognizing my work from the game "Starsector" (available at www.fractalsoftworks.com for a very reasonable price). What prompted me to draw this asset pack was the high number of people taking assets from Starsector and trying to sell them as part of commercial games -- this is clearly copyright infringement, but it led me to consider that perhaps there's a niche not being properly fulfilled. So why not get two birds with one stone? I could release a pack for sale while, hopefully, cutting down on the number of copyright takedowns Alex has to deal with. (He's the developer of Starsector btw- a great guy, and he's very supportive of my work here.)

Anyhow, I hope you enjoy these and make cool games. If you send me screenshots or video of games you make with these assets, I'd love to see them. If you have any problems with these assets, please email me and I'll get you fixed up ASAP. I'm also very open to suggestions for assets you'd like to see - more ships, I'm sure, but maybe ideas for types of ships and weapons and effects sprites. 

(I do have plans for an additional 3 ship style sets done as an expansion pack, though how quickly I get to them depends a lot on how well this pack sells.)
